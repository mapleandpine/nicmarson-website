role-description: I worked as a contractor for Isite Design along with Petra Gregorová and Alex Mahan. Tasks were divided evenly among us as we designed and coded menus, jQuery plugins, graphics, and whatever was needed to reach our goal. This was a great collaboration effort, and Jive Software remains one of the best companies I’ve ever worked for.
