role-description: I built user-interfaces from images and wireframes. I had ownership of the portal theme, templates, and styleguide. I used Sublime Text to code and Grunt to build. I designed directly in the browser using the Twitter Bootstrap framework and SCSS. I encouraged responsive design, accessibility, and more efficient coding practices.

      <p>This project is significant because it’s my very first venture into freelancing as a web developer rather than just a web designer. The site is a personal promotional page for my former InFocus coworker, and friend, Keri Moran. It’s design, and overall scheme, was inspired by Keri’s photography.</p>

      <p>I spent a good deal of time in consultation and planning. I made sketches and notes. We worked together on content. I created the design in Fireworks and used Dreamweaver to code the site. The purpose of the site was to help Keri secure a position at Microsoft, and it worked!</p>
