role-description: I worked with the owner on the look and feel of the site. The design process started with sketches and concluded with full composites in Adobe Fireworks. Front-end development started with a base template that provided a blank slate to scaffold the design to. A Wordpress Blog was initially integrated, but discarded in favor of the Magento CMS.

  <p class="lead">I've been working with Kori Giudici since the first version of Flipside Hats in 2008. We met through a mutual friend, and since then, I've designed and built each subsequent version. I'm always impressed with Kori's skills and eye for design. It's been a pleasure seeing her brand develop.</p>

      <p>This project is a Magento based e-commerce store, and a WordPress powered blog. The Magento theme is completely custom. Several months of working with an agency that only did Magento sites had taught me how to edit this robust e-commerce solution without messing things up. I assisted the Flipside Hats team in how to set up their store, enter products, edit pages, and handle payments and shipping.</p>

    <div class="group group--one--gutter">
      <p>In addition to the Magento site, I also set up a Wordpress blog to handle announcements and events.</p>
      <p>This is the third version of the Flipside Hats website I created. The first was a simple informational site, the second was an earlier version of the Magento store.</p>
