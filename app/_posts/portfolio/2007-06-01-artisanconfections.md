  <p class="lead">This was Hershey’s umbrella company for their premium brands: Scharffenberger Chocolate, Joseph Schmidt Confections, and Dagoba Organic Chocolate.</p>

      <p>At the time I started, their current e-commerce system was outdated. It was written in original ASP, and the software was obscure and not well supported.</p>
      <p>The supreme challenge was to combine four stores into one system, all while maintaining their unique look and feel. This feat was accomplished by dynamically loading different style sheets based on which store’s unique session key was currently active.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="group group--one--gutter">
      <p>My overall web based tasks for Hersheys were to design all the stores; build and integrate site themes; maintain and troubleshoot web sites; prepare and launch email campaigns; add, edit, and remove content and media; record and report weekly to Hersheys on site statistics.</p>
