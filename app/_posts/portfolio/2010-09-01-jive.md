Working as a contractor for Isite Design, and alongside two other front-end developers to build a redesigned Jive Software website. UI tasks were divided evenly among us as we designed and coded menus, jQuery plugins, graphics, and whatever was needed to reach our goal. This was a great collaboration effort, and Jive Software remains one of the best companies Iâ€™ve ever worked for.
