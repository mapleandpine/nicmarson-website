<p>This project is significant because it’s my very first venture into freelancing. The site is a personal promotional page for my former InFocus coworker, and friend, Keri Moran. It’s design, and overall scheme, was inspired by Keri’s photography. The purpose of the site was to help her secure a position at Microsoft, and it worked!</p>
