I’ve been working with Kori Giudici since the first version of her web site, Flipside Hats. We met through a mutual friend, and since then, I’ve designed and built each subsequent version. I'm always impressed with Kori's skills and eye for design. It's been a pleasure seeing her brand develop.

This project is a Magento based e-commerce store, and a WordPress powered blog. The Magento theme is completely custom. Several months of working with an agency that only did Magento sites had taught me how to edit this robust e-commerce solution without messing things up. I assisted the Flipside Hats team in how to set up their store, enter products, edit pages, and handle payments and shipping.

In addition to the Magento site, I also set up a Wordpress blog to handle announcements and events.

This is the third version of the Flipside Hats website I created. The first was a simple informational site, the second was an earlier version of the Magento store.
