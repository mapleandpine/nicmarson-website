I’ve been working with Kori Giudici since the first version of her web site, Flipside Hats. We met through a mutual friend, and since then, I’ve designed and built each subsequent version. This project is a Magento based e-commerce store, and a WordPress powered blog.

The Magento theme is completely custom. Several months of working with an agency that only did Magento sites had taught me how to edit this robust e-commerce solution without messing things up.
