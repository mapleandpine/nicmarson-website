The founders, Courtney Dillard and Matt Webber, returned from their travels in South America determined to make a difference by focusing on a particular community and partnering with local animal activists in the region. To date The Perros Project has positively impacted hundreds of dogs by its activities on the ground and its ongoing support of local animal organizations and veterinary clinics.

I built a WordPress template based on an existing purchased HTML template. For non-profit websites I work towards a goal of education, and the potential of having the client maintain the site on their own. We formed a great relationship, and I continue to work on other project for this client.
