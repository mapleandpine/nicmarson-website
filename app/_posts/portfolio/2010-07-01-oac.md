Freelance contract front-end development and design for the non-profit site, Oregon Arts Commission. I worked closely with representatives from the State of Oregon, as my clients, and generators of the site content.

This project encompassed a full redesign, entirely new content, integration with other systems, and many UI enhancements including some custom jQuery functions.
