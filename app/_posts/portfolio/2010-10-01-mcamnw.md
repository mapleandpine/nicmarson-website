This is a custom WordPress template design in which I collaborated with designer, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/valerie-malcolm/20/991/2b4">Valerie Malcolm</a>.

I have been involved for most of the history of MCAM Northwest, and the entirety of their side project, Streaming Teacher. During my time working for them, I honed my skills in design and hand-coding web sites. I worked on everything from signs to fully built websites, and everything in between. Iâ€™ve done logo design, advertising, slideshows, presentations, and talent location and collaboration.

The 2010 redesign was done to accomodate their acquisition of Autodesk products. It followed a redesign that I had done only a year earlier. Their side project, Streaming Teacher, provides educational videos and other courseware to the mechanical engineering sector of the workforce, and has partnerships with local educational facilities.
