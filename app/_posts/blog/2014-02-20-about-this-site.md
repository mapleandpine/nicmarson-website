This site takes inspiration from around the web. It grew from a basic idea and has evolved as I've worked on it. I wanted to keep it simple, so I took a mobile first approach, then added enhancements for the desktop.

The build process utilizes the power of Grunt.

The development environment and build system are generated by generator-jekyllrb. For development, build, and deploy instructions see the usage section in the generator's README.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
