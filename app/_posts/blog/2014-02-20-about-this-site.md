Building myself a website is easily the hardest thing I've ever done in my career. It's not because I lack the skills in design or coding, it's because I have trouble deciding on visual styles and techniques. With so much inspiration from around the world, and a vast collection of code snippets to choose from, the hardest thing for a designer is to have too much freedom. The only thing to do, is to decide on what's most important to you, and what represents you the best.

This site takes inspiration from around the web. It grew from a basic idea and has evolved as I've worked on it. I wanted to keep it simple, so I took a mobile first approach, then added enhancements for the desktop.

The build process utilizes the power of Grunt.

The development environment and build system are generated by generator-jekyllrb.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
