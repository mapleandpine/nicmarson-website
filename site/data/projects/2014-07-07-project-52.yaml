Days before her seventeeth birthday, with her mom in the hospital, and her fate determined, a mysterious puzzle arrives to change her destiny. A cryptic message suggests that these curses are symptoms of untapped powers. Jenny must solve a puzzle to join a space-faring corporation called Skalla Enterprises. She encounters giants and aliens, and people with powers over the physical world. A great destiny awaits her â€¦ if Jenny can survive the encounter.
