description: I worked with the owner on the look and feel of the site. The design process started with sketches and concluded with full composites in Adobe Fireworks. Front-end development started with a base template that provided a blank slate to scaffold the design to. A Wordpress Blog was initially integrated, but discarded in favor of the Magento CMS.
