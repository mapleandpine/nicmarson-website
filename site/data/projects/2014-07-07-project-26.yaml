description: This was my first custom WordPress template. Pop Art provided the design, and I provided a custom theme and admin pages. The template build required a quick turnaround, 5 days, because of late design deliverables. Despite working until 5am a couple of nights, or maybe because of, I was able to deliver the product on time and finished.
