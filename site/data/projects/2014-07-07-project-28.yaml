description: I worked with a PHP back-end coder to develop a custom website for Rockband. The siteâ€™s purpose was to be a tool for bars to host Rockband themed events. It was built using Drupal and contained many custom templates, jQuery plugins, and admin customization to achieve the desired look and feel.
