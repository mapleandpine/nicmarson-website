description: Front-end development and design for the local sock company, Sock It To Me. They needed an e-commerce store and WordPress blog to match their new branding. I worked alongside the owner and office manager to guide me in the right direction. I used HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP to build the CS-Cart and WordPress templates.
