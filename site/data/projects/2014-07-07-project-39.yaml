description: I built user-interfaces from images and wireframes. I had ownership of the portal theme, templates, and styleguide. I used Sublime Text to code and Grunt to build. I designed directly in the browser using the Twitter Bootstrap framework and SCSS. I encouraged responsive design, accessibility, and more efficient coding practices.
