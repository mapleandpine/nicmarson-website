description: This project was my first freelance collaboration with another designer, Valerie Job. She provided the client and the designs. Then it was up to me to develop a WordPress template. I used Fireworks for image slicing and optimization. The build required hand-coding CSS, HTML, and PHP as well as some custom functions.
