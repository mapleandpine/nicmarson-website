description: As Web Master for Climate Clean I was responsible for designing, building, and maintaining our corporate and satellite web sites. These sites were built to use WordPress as a management system with custom built and designed templates. In addition, I also designed the corporate identity systems, and kiosks for use in auto dealerships.
